Oops ("Object Oriented Programming") in Python with Example
"Oops" in Python stands for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects. Objects encapsulate data (attributes) and the behavior associated with that data (methods). This approach promotes modularity, code reusability, and maintainability.

Here's a simple example demonstrating OOP in Python:
class Dog:
  def __init__(self, name, breed, age):
    self.name = name
    self.breed = breed
    self.age = age

  def bark(self):
    print(f"{self.name} says woof!")

  def play_fetch(self):
    print(f"{self.name} loves playing fetch!")

# Create an object (instance) of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever", 3)

# Access object attributes
print(f"Dog's name: {my_dog.name}")
print(f"Dog's breed: {my_dog.breed}")
print(f"Dog's age: {my_dog.age}")

# Call object methods
my_dog.bark()
my_dog.play_fetch()

Explanation:

Class definition: The Dog class defines the blueprint for creating dog objects. It has:

__init__: The constructor initializes the object with attributes like name, breed, and age.
bark and play_fetch: Methods define behaviors specific to dogs.
Object creation: The my_dog object is an instance of the Dog class with its own set of attributes and methods.

Accessing attributes: We can access object attributes using the dot notation (e.g., my_dog.name).

Calling methods: Methods are invoked by their name followed by parentheses (e.g., my_dog.bark()).

This is a basic example, but it demonstrates how OOP in Python helps organize code around objects, making it more efficient and reusable.

Benefits of OOP:

Modularity: Code is organized into smaller, self-contained units (objects).
Reusability: Objects can be reused in different parts of the program.
Maintainability: Changes to one object have less impact on other parts of the code.
Data encapsulation: Objects protect data from unauthorized access.
